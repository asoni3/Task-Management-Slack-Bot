## Task Management Bot

## 1. Problem Statement:  
**What is the problem:** 

## 2. Bot Description:  
  * The task management bot is Slack based interactive bot which simplifies our job to manage the Slack channel and 
Trello board both for a single project management. The user can directly interact with the bot 
from the Slack desktop application or web browser to manage their tasks without even opening the Trello.  
  * The bot provides the user various alternatives to start their new board with templates for like Scrum board. 
  Moreover, the user can also do modifications/personalization they require at the time of creating the new board 
  from Slack itself. So, the user doesnâ€™t have to create the individual lists for Scrum every time they create a new board 
  in Trello and the bot saves the Software Engineer time for initial setup process and helps them 
  to increase the productivity of the software.  
  * The manager and team members can easily look for their backlogs, on-going tasks and tasks which will have the deadline soon, 
  just by asking a simple question to the bot in the Slack for their specific requests, as they are interacting with a person. 
  The user or team lead can also assign the task to other team members, set the deadline while creating the new card. 
  In addition to this, the software engineer can also look for the highly prioritized tasks which he/she needs to complete with 
  highest priority. So, by interacting this kind of stuff with the bot in the channel, 
  will also eventually update the manager(team lead) and other team members, on which part he/she is working on and 
  which tasks have been completed for better productivity and communication within the team.  
  * Now, when the user has completed the task and they want to show their completed work by attaching their Github branch or 
  other documentation links, they can simply attach the link by telling the bot that they have completed 
  with this reference which team lead / other team-mates can look for and it also helps to track the record when required 
  in an organized way.  
  * This way, the task management bot simplifies the way to handle Slack and Trello both and gives power to manage the tasks 
  within the Slack in an interactive manner.

Constraints:  
  * **Slack:** At any point of time, we can connect only one Trello board to one Slack channel.
   So, if we want to manage different boards simultaneously, we should have the respective slack channel for each of the board  
   * **Trello:**
